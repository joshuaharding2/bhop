                <div class="update-desc">Only on: https://joshuaharding2.github.io/bhop/textures<br>I added basic
                    textures to
                    the game<br>I made it in like 5 minutes, and I'm not sure if it's good<br>Additionally, I adjusted
                    the strafe
                    keys (a and d) to be slightly fairer. Previously, if both keys were pressed, it would always favor
                    going left.
                    Now it will favor whichever direction was pressed last. This should not change anything except
                    perhaps start
                    turning right a few frames earlier than previously.<br>Play this version if you want to test core
                    gameplay
                    changes I'm not sure about yet.

                <div class="update-desc">It's been a while! I decided to make this a major update since how many things
                    I
                    changed and we got a new domain and stuff (it's https://bhop.site use it if you can and aren't
                    already because
                    the codehs one is sometimes really slow to load for some reason)<br>You should still join the
                    discord server:
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/TcTvmwxgJb" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/TcTvmwxgJb</a><br>And
                    also I do not
                    think this list covers everything i've changed because there's so many little changes I probably
                    forgot about
                    or can't remember right now. Here we go<br>Added fullscreen option in pause menu becuase I made a
                    pwa desktop
                    app and I didn't like the visible bar at the top<br>Finished input recording system and replay
                    system (used
                    for checking authenticity of runs and TAS runs)<br>Fully Created another recording system that just
                    stores
                    your position, direction, and total time each frame (used for watching replays and making ghosts on
                    frontend)<br>Used this 2nd replay system to make replays and ghosts accessable in game through
                    buttons on the
                    top right: These work for world record and author record (but the buttons only show up if there is a
                    valid
                    replay code and all the world records at the time of release are old and don't have one :/)<br>I
                    made the
                    entire game have a forced aspect ratio<br>This makes all UI the same size no matter what screen
                    resolution
                    you're using (black bars on the sides if it doesn't fit)<br>I also resized the ui to be bigger
                    because this
                    shrinked it a little and it was smaller than intended already. This was because I developed the game
                    on a
                    crappy school computer (don't worry I'm using my home computer now that it's summer) and the screen
                    was small
                    so I liked to change the screen resolution so things were bigger and I could see but didn't realize
                    that for
                    everyone else the UI would be smaller.<br>I am planning on adding customization to aspect ratio and
                    resolution
                    later (including UI size)<br>You may also have noticed that the base bhop.site page is an account
                    creation
                    page (you can make one, but it doesn't do anything yet.) I am planning on making this save times and
                    stuff and
                    maybe even be able to upload levels on your account? It has a lot of potential I need to get working
                    on
                    that<br>Added mobile support:<br>If you're on mobile and start the game you'll see some buttons that
                    control
                    the game (unless my mobile device detection code is wrong let me know if it is)<br>In case you want
                    to use a
                    keyboard and the mobile buttons are in the way the mobile buttons will dissapear if the website
                    detects any
                    key input (assumes you don't need them)<br>The reset button resets the player unless you press it
                    twice within
                    1 second then it will fully reset you<br>I also made a manifest.json and service worker so it runs
                    offline if
                    you add the website to homescreen (and it launches in fullscreen too!)<br>Oh also I added favicons
                    to the
                    website and app (icons next to the tab name, app icons, stuff like that)<br>Minor
                    changes:<br>Direction
                    reporter in top left actually makes sense now (I was using the wrong vector3 lol)<br>Version numbers
                    now only
                    have 3 numbers and have a v before it<br>When you submit a record now it stores the current version
                    number<br>Campaign level data is now stored in the main html file instead of other files (no loading
                    time,
                    works offline, no fetching errors)<br>Key inputs are no longer case sensitive<br>I made this menu
                    way wider so
                    it could fit all this text on one screen since now with the aspect ratio you can't scroll anymore (I
                    also made
                    the text smaller)<br>Removed outdated info on credits page<br>Fixed typo on 3rd button of 2nd row of
                    3rd
                    campaign<br>Added warning when you open the console on the website<br>As a sideproduct of storing
                    level data
                    in the main file now the loadLevelFromFile(); function is useless<br>I'm probably gonna think of
                    more
                    things to add to this list later but that's all I can remember for now
